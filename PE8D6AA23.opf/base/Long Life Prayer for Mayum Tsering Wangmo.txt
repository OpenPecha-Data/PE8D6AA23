Prayer for the Long Life of Mayum Tsering Wangmo
by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
tubwang tsuktor nampar gyal lasok
Through the blessings of Śākyamuni, Uṣṇīṣavijayā and the rest
sangye changsem tselhé jinlab kyi
The buddhas, bodhisattvas and long-life deities,
pema tsering wangmo shyabpé ten
May the life of Pema Tsering Wangmo remain secure,
shyedön lhün gyi drubpar solwa deb
And may all her aspirations be spontaneously fulfilled.

In response to requests made together with the support of white offering scarves by the nuns
of Lerab Ling, Ngawang Sangyé, Damchö and Samten, the Buddhist monk called Ngawang Chökyi
Lodrö wrote this on the first day of the fifth month of the Water Sheep year (30 June 2003)
at the Dharma centre of Lerab Ling. Virtue!
